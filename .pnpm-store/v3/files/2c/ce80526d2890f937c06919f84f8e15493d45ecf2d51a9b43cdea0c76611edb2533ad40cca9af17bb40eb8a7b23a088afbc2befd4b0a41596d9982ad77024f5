declare const _default: "# Manual Setup\n\nTo set up TanStack Router manually in a React project, follow the steps below. This gives you a bare minimum setup to get going with TanStack Router using both file-based route generation and code-based route configuration:\n\n## Using File-Based Route Generation\n\n#### Install TanStack Router, Vite Plugin, and the Router Devtools\n\n```sh\nnpm install @tanstack/react-router @tanstack/react-router-devtools\nnpm install -D @tanstack/router-plugin\n# or\npnpm add @tanstack/react-router @tanstack/react-router-devtools\npnpm add -D @tanstack/router-plugin\n# or\nyarn add @tanstack/react-router @tanstack/react-router-devtools\nyarn add -D @tanstack/router-plugin\n# or\nbun add @tanstack/react-router @tanstack/react-router-devtools\nbun add -D @tanstack/router-plugin\n# or\ndeno add npm:@tanstack/react-router npm:@tanstack/router-plugin npm:@tanstack/react-router-devtools\n```\n\n#### Configure the Vite Plugin\n\n```tsx\n// vite.config.ts\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\nimport react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'\nimport { tanstackRouter } from '@tanstack/router-plugin/vite'\n\n// https://vitejs.dev/config/\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    // Please make sure that '@tanstack/router-plugin' is passed before '@vitejs/plugin-react'\n    tanstackRouter({\n      target: 'react',\n      autoCodeSplitting: true,\n    }),\n    react(),\n    // ...,\n  ],\n})\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> If you are not using Vite, or any of the supported bundlers, you can check out the [TanStack Router CLI](../with-router-cli) guide for more info.\n\nCreate the following files:\n\n- `src/routes/__root.tsx` (with two '`_`' characters)\n- `src/routes/index.tsx`\n- `src/routes/about.tsx`\n- `src/main.tsx`\n\n#### `src/routes/__root.tsx`\n\n```tsx\nimport { createRootRoute, Link, Outlet } from '@tanstack/react-router'\nimport { TanStackRouterDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-router-devtools'\n\nconst RootLayout = () => (\n  <>\n    <div className=\"p-2 flex gap-2\">\n      <Link to=\"/\" className=\"[&.active]:font-bold\">\n        Home\n      </Link>{' '}\n      <Link to=\"/about\" className=\"[&.active]:font-bold\">\n        About\n      </Link>\n    </div>\n    <hr />\n    <Outlet />\n    <TanStackRouterDevtools />\n  </>\n)\n\nexport const Route = createRootRoute({ component: RootLayout })\n```\n\n#### `src/routes/index.tsx`\n\n```tsx\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/')({\n  component: Index,\n})\n\nfunction Index() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"p-2\">\n      <h3>Welcome Home!</h3>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n#### `src/routes/about.tsx`\n\n```tsx\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/about')({\n  component: About,\n})\n\nfunction About() {\n  return <div className=\"p-2\">Hello from About!</div>\n}\n```\n\n#### `src/main.tsx`\n\nRegardless of whether you are using the `@tanstack/router-plugin` package and running the `npm run dev`/`npm run build` scripts, or manually running the `tsr watch`/`tsr generate` commands from your package scripts, the route tree file will be generated at `src/routeTree.gen.ts`.\n\nImport the generated route tree and create a new router instance:\n\n```tsx\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react'\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'\nimport { RouterProvider, createRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router'\n\n// Import the generated route tree\nimport { routeTree } from './routeTree.gen'\n\n// Create a new router instance\nconst router = createRouter({ routeTree })\n\n// Register the router instance for type safety\ndeclare module '@tanstack/react-router' {\n  interface Register {\n    router: typeof router\n  }\n}\n\n// Render the app\nconst rootElement = document.getElementById('root')!\nif (!rootElement.innerHTML) {\n  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement)\n  root.render(\n    <StrictMode>\n      <RouterProvider router={router} />\n    </StrictMode>,\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIf you are working with this pattern you should change the `id` of the root `<div>` on your `index.html` file to `<div id='root'></div>`\n\n## Using Code-Based Route Configuration\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> The following example shows how to configure routes using code, and for simplicity's sake is in a single file for this demo. While code-based generation allows you to declare many routes and even the router instance in a single file, we recommend splitting your routes into separate files for better organization and performance as your application grows.\n\n```tsx\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react'\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'\nimport {\n  Outlet,\n  RouterProvider,\n  Link,\n  createRouter,\n  createRoute,\n  createRootRoute,\n} from '@tanstack/react-router'\nimport { TanStackRouterDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-router-devtools'\n\nconst rootRoute = createRootRoute({\n  component: () => (\n    <>\n      <div className=\"p-2 flex gap-2\">\n        <Link to=\"/\" className=\"[&.active]:font-bold\">\n          Home\n        </Link>{' '}\n        <Link to=\"/about\" className=\"[&.active]:font-bold\">\n          About\n        </Link>\n      </div>\n      <hr />\n      <Outlet />\n      <TanStackRouterDevtools />\n    </>\n  ),\n})\n\nconst indexRoute = createRoute({\n  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,\n  path: '/',\n  component: function Index() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"p-2\">\n        <h3>Welcome Home!</h3>\n      </div>\n    )\n  },\n})\n\nconst aboutRoute = createRoute({\n  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,\n  path: '/about',\n  component: function About() {\n    return <div className=\"p-2\">Hello from About!</div>\n  },\n})\n\nconst routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([indexRoute, aboutRoute])\n\nconst router = createRouter({ routeTree })\n\ndeclare module '@tanstack/react-router' {\n  interface Register {\n    router: typeof router\n  }\n}\n\nconst rootElement = document.getElementById('app')!\nif (!rootElement.innerHTML) {\n  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement)\n  root.render(\n    <StrictMode>\n      <RouterProvider router={router} />\n    </StrictMode>,\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIf you glossed over these examples or didn't understand something, we don't blame you, because there's so much more to learn to really take advantage of TanStack Router! Let's move on.\n\n# Migration from React Location\n\nBefore you begin your journey in migrating from React Location, it's important that you have a good understanding of the [Routing Concepts](../routing/routing-concepts.md) and [Design Decisions](../decisions-on-dx.md) used by TanStack Router.\n\n## Differences between React Location and TanStack Router\n\nReact Location and TanStack Router share much of same design decisions concepts, but there are some key differences that you should be aware of.\n\n- React Location uses _generics_ to infer types for routes, while TanStack Router uses _module declaration merging_ to infer types.\n- Route configuration in React Location is done using a single array of route definitions, while in TanStack Router, route configuration is done using a tree of route definitions starting with the [root route](../routing/routing-concepts.md#the-root-route).\n- [File-based routing](../routing/file-based-routing.md) is the recommended way to define routes in TanStack Router, while React Location only allows you to define routes in a single file using a code-based approach.\n  - TanStack Router does support a [code-based approach](../routing/code-based-routing.md) to defining routes, but it is not recommended for most use cases. You can read more about why, over here: [why is file-based routing the preferred way to define routes?](../decisions-on-dx.md#3-why-is-file-based-routing-the-preferred-way-to-define-routes)\n\n## Migration guide\n\nIn this guide we'll go over the process of migrating the [React Location Basic example](https://github.com/TanStack/router/tree/react-location/examples/basic) over to TanStack Router using file-based routing, with the end goal of having the same functionality as the original example (styling and other non-routing related code will be omitted).\n\n> [!TIP]\n> To use a code-based approach for defining your routes, you can read the [code-based Routing](../routing/code-based-routing.md) guide.\n\n### Step 1: Swap over to TanStack Router's dependencies\n\nFirst, we need to install the dependencies for TanStack Router. For detailed installation instructions, see our [How to Install TanStack Router](../how-to/install.md) guide.\n\n```sh\nnpm install @tanstack/react-router @tanstack/router-devtools\n```\n\nAnd remove the React Location dependencies.\n\n```sh\nnpm uninstall @tanstack/react-location @tanstack/react-location-devtools\n```\n\n### Step 2: Use the file-based routing watcher\n\nIf your project uses Vite (or one of the supported bundlers), you can use the TanStack Router plugin to watch for changes in your routes files and automatically update the routes configuration.\n\nInstallation of the Vite plugin:\n\n```sh\nnpm install -D @tanstack/router-plugin\n```\n\nAnd add it to your `vite.config.js`:\n\n```js\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\nimport react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'\nimport { tanstackRouter } from '@tanstack/router-plugin/vite'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // ...\n  plugins: [tanstackRouter(), react()],\n})\n```\n\nHowever, if your application does not use Vite, you use one of our other [supported bundlers](../routing/file-based-routing.md#getting-started-with-file-based-routing), or you can use the `@tanstack/router-cli` package to watch for changes in your routes files and automatically update the routes configuration.\n\n### Step 3: Add the file-based configuration file to your project\n\nCreate a `tsr.config.json` file in the root of your project with the following content:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"routesDirectory\": \"./src/routes\",\n  \"generatedRouteTree\": \"./src/routeTree.gen.ts\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can find the full list of options for the `tsr.config.json` file [here](../../../api/file-based-routing.md).\n\n### Step 4: Create the routes directory\n\nCreate a `routes` directory in the `src` directory of your project.\n\n```sh\nmkdir src/routes\n```\n\n### Step 5: Create the root route file\n\n```tsx\n// src/routes/__root.tsx\nimport { createRootRoute, Outlet, Link } from '@tanstack/react-router'\nimport { TanStackRouterDevtools } from '@tanstack/router-devtools'\n\nexport const Route = createRootRoute({\n  component: () => {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <div>\n          <Link to=\"/\" activeOptions={{ exact: true }}>\n            Home\n          </Link>\n          <Link to=\"/posts\">Posts</Link>\n        </div>\n        <hr />\n        <Outlet />\n        <TanStackRouterDevtools />\n      </>\n    )\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Step 6: Create the index route file\n\n```tsx\n// src/routes/index.tsx\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/')({\n  component: Index,\n})\n```\n\n> You will need to move any related components and logic needed for the index route from the `src/index.tsx` file to the `src/routes/index.tsx` file.\n\n### Step 7: Create the posts route file\n\n```tsx\n// src/routes/posts.tsx\nimport { createFileRoute, Link, Outlet } from '@tanstack/react-router'\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/posts')({\n  component: Posts,\n  loader: async () => {\n    const posts = await fetchPosts()\n    return {\n      posts,\n    }\n  },\n})\n\nfunction Posts() {\n  const { posts } = Route.useLoaderData()\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <nav>\n        {posts.map((post) => (\n          <Link\n            key={post.id}\n            to={`/posts/$postId`}\n            params={{ postId: post.id }}\n          >\n            {post.title}\n          </Link>\n        ))}\n      </nav>\n      <Outlet />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> You will need to move any related components and logic needed for the posts route from the `src/index.tsx` file to the `src/routes/posts.tsx` file.\n\n### Step 8: Create the posts index route file\n\n```tsx\n// src/routes/posts.index.tsx\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/posts/')({\n  component: PostsIndex,\n})\n```\n\n> You will need to move any related components and logic needed for the posts index route from the `src/index.tsx` file to the `src/routes/posts.index.tsx` file.\n\n### Step 9: Create the posts id route file\n\n```tsx\n// src/routes/posts.$postId.tsx\nimport { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'\n\nexport const Route = createFileRoute('/posts/$postId')({\n  component: PostsId,\n  loader: async ({ params: { postId } }) => {\n    const post = await fetchPost(postId)\n    return {\n      post,\n    }\n  },\n})\n\nfunction PostsId() {\n  const { post } = Route.useLoaderData()\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n> You will need to move any related components and logic needed for the posts id route from the `src/index.tsx` file to the `src/routes/posts.$postId.tsx` file.\n\n### Step 10: Generate the route tree\n\nIf you are using one of the supported bundlers, the route tree will be generated automatically when you run the dev script.\n\nIf you are not using one of the supported bundlers, you can generate the route tree by running the following command:\n\n```sh\nnpx tsr generate\n```\n\n### Step 11: Update the main entry file to render the Router\n\nOnce you've generated the route-tree, you can then update the `src/index.tsx` file to create the router instance and render it.\n\n```tsx\n// src/index.tsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\nimport { createRouter, RouterProvider } from '@tanstack/react-router'\n\n// Import the generated route tree\nimport { routeTree } from './routeTree.gen'\n\n// Create a new router instance\nconst router = createRouter({ routeTree })\n\n// Register the router instance for type safety\ndeclare module '@tanstack/react-router' {\n  interface Register {\n    router: typeof router\n  }\n}\n\nconst domElementId = 'root' // Assuming you have a root element with the id 'root'\n\n// Render the app\nconst rootElement = document.getElementById(domElementId)\nif (!rootElement) {\n  throw new Error(`Element with id ${domElementId} not found`)\n}\n\nReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement).render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <RouterProvider router={router} />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n)\n```\n\n### Finished!\n\nYou should now have successfully migrated your application from React Location to TanStack Router using file-based routing.\n\nReact Location also has a few more features that you might be using in your application. Here are some guides to help you migrate those features:\n\n- [Search params](../guide/search-params.md)\n- [Data loading](../guide/data-loading.md)\n- [History types](../guide/history-types.md)\n- [Wildcard / Splat / Catch-all routes](../routing/routing-concepts.md#splat--catch-all-routes)\n- [Authenticated routes](../guide/authenticated-routes.md)\n\nTanStack Router also has a few more features that you might want to explore:\n\n- [Router Context](../guide/router-context.md)\n- [Preloading](../guide/preloading.md)\n- [Pathless Layout Routes](../routing/routing-concepts.md#pathless-layout-routes)\n- [Route masking](../guide/route-masking.md)\n- [SSR](../guide/ssr.md)\n- ... and more!\n\nIf you are facing any issues or have any questions, feel free to ask for help in the TanStack Discord.\n\n# Migration from React Router Checklist\n\n**_If your UI is blank, open the console, and you will probably have some errors that read something along the lines of `cannot use 'useNavigate' outside of context` . This means there are React Router api\u2019s that are still imported and referenced that you need to find and remove. The easiest way to make sure you find all React Router imports is to uninstall `react-router-dom` and then you should get typescript errors in your files. Then you will know what to change to a `@tanstack/react-router` import._**\n\nHere is the [example repo](https://github.com/Benanna2019/SickFitsForEveryone/tree/migrate-to-tanstack/router/React-Router)\n\n- [ ] Install Router - `npm i @tanstack/react-router` (see [detailed installation guide](../how-to/install.md))\n- [ ] **Optional:** Uninstall React Router to get TypeScript errors on imports.\n  - At this point I don\u2019t know if you can do a gradual migration, but it seems likely you could have multiple router providers, not desirable.\n  - The api\u2019s between React Router and TanStack Router are very similar and could most likely be handled in a sprint cycle or two if that is your companies way of doing things.\n- [ ] Create Routes for each existing React Router route we have\n- [ ] Create root route\n- [ ] Create router instance\n- [ ] Add global module in main.tsx\n- [ ] Remove any React Router (`createBrowserRouter` or `BrowserRouter`), `Routes`, and `Route` Components from main.tsx\n- [ ] **Optional:** Refactor `render` function for custom setup/providers - The repo referenced above has an example - This was necessary in the case of Supertokens. Supertoken has a specific setup with React Router and a different setup with all other React implementations\n- [ ] Set RouterProvider and pass it the router as the prop\n- [ ] Replace all instances of React Router `Link` component with `@tanstack/react-router` `Link` component\n  - [ ] Add `to` prop with literal path\n  - [ ] Add `params` prop, where necessary with params like so `params={{ orderId: order.id }}`\n- [ ] Replace all instances of React Router `useNavigate` hook with `@tanstack/react-router` `useNavigate` hook\n  - [ ] Set `to` property and `params` property where needed\n- [ ] Replace any React Router `Outlet`'s with the `@tanstack/react-router` equivalent\n- [ ] If you are using `useSearchParams` hook from React Router, move the search params default value to the validateSearch property on a Route definition.\n  - [ ] Instead of using the `useSearchParams` hook, use `@tanstack/react-router` `Link`'s search property to update the search params state\n  - [ ] To read search params you can do something like the following\n    - `const { page } = useSearch({ from: productPage.fullPath })`\n- [ ] If using React Router\u2019s `useParams` hook, update the import to be from `@tanstack/react-router` and set the `from` property to the literal path name where you want to read the params object from\n  - So say we have a route with the path name `orders/$orderid`.\n  - In the `useParams` hook we would set up our hook like so: `const params = useParams({ from: \"/orders/$orderId\" })`\n  - Then wherever we wanted to access the order id we would get it off of the params object `params.orderId`\n\n# Installation with Esbuild\n\n[//]: # 'BundlerConfiguration'\n\nTo use file-based routing with **Esbuild**, you'll need to install the `@tanstack/router-plugin` package.\n\n```sh\nnpm install -D @tanstack/router-plugin\n```\n\nOnce installed, you'll need to add the plugin to your configuration.\n\n```tsx\n// esbuild.config.js\nimport { tanstackRouter } from '@tanstack/router-plugin/esbuild'\n\nexport default {\n  // ...\n  plugins: [\n    tanstackRouter({\n      target: 'react',\n      autoCodeSplitting: true,\n    }),\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nOr, you can clone our [Quickstart Esbuild example](https://github.com/TanStack/router/tree/main/examples/react/quickstart-esbuild-file-based) and get started.\n\nNow that you've added the plugin to your Esbuild configuration, you're all set to start using file-based routing with TanStack Router.\n\n[//]: # 'BundlerConfiguration'\n\n## Ignoring the generated route tree file\n\nIf your project is configured to use a linter and/or formatter, you may want to ignore the generated route tree file.
