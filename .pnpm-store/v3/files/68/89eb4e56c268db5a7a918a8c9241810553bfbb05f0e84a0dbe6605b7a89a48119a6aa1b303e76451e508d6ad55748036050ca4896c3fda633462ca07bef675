/**
 * Read and select the nearest or targeted route match.
 *
 * Options:
 * - `from`/`strict`: Target a specific route ID and control union vs. exact typing
 * - `select`: Project the match object to a derived value
 * - `shouldThrow`: Throw if the match is not found in strict contexts
 * - `structuralSharing`: Enable structural sharing for stable references
 *
 * @returns The active match (or selected value).
