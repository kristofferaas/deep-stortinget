# Convex Workflow

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@convex-dev%2Fworkflow.svg?)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@convex-dev%2Fworkflow)

<!-- START: Include on https://convex.dev/components -->

Have you ever wanted to run a series of functions reliably and durably, where
each can have its own retry behavior, the overall workflow will survive server
restarts, and you can have long-running workflows spanning months that can be
canceled? Do you want to observe the status of a workflow reactively, as well as
the results written from each step?

And do you want to do this with code, instead of a DSL?

Welcome to the world of Convex workflows.

- Run workflows asynchronously, and observe their status reactively via
  subscriptions, from one or many users simultaneously, even on page refreshes.
- Workflows can run for months, and survive server restarts. You can specify
  delays or custom times to run each step.
- Run steps in parallel, or in sequence.
- Output from previous steps is available to pass to subsequent steps.
- Run queries, mutations, and actions.
- Specify retry behavior on a per-step basis, along with a default policy.
- Specify how many workflow steps can run in parallel to manage load.
- Cancel long-running workflows.
- Clean up workflows after they're done.

```ts
import { WorkflowManager } from "@convex-dev/workflow";
import { components } from "./_generated/api";

export const workflow = new WorkflowManager(components.workflow);

export const exampleWorkflow = workflow.define({
  args: {
    storageId: v.id("_storage"),
  },
  handler: async (step, args): Promise<number[]> => {
    const transcription = await step.runAction(
      internal.index.computeTranscription,
      { storageId: args.storageId },
    );

    const embedding = await step.runAction(
      internal.index.computeEmbedding,
      { transcription },
      // Run this a month after the transcription is computed.
      { runAfter: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 },
    );
    return embedding;
  },
});
```

This component adds durably executed _workflows_ to Convex. Combine Convex queries, mutations,
and actions into long-lived workflows, and the system will always fully execute a workflow
to completion.

## Installation

First, add `@convex-dev/workflow` to your Convex project:

```sh
npm install @convex-dev/workflow
```

Then, install the component within your `convex/convex.config.ts` file:

```ts
// convex/convex.config.ts
import workflow from "@convex-dev/workflow/convex.config";
import { defineApp } from "convex/server";

const app = defineApp();
app.use(workflow);
export default app;
```

Finally, create a workflow manager within your `convex/` folder, and point it
to the installed component:

```ts
// convex/index.ts
import { WorkflowManager } from "@convex-dev/workflow";
import { components } from "./_generated/api";

export const workflow = new WorkflowManager(components.workflow);
```

## Usage

The first step is to define a workflow using `workflow.define()`. This function
is designed to feel like a Convex action but with a few restrictions:

1. The workflow runs in the background, so it can't return a value.
2. The workflow must be _deterministic_, so it should implement most of its logic
   by calling out to other Convex functions. We will be lifting some of these
   restrictions over time by implementing `Math.random()`, `Date.now()`, and
   `fetch` within our workflow environment.

Note: To help avoid type cycles, always annotate the return type of the `handler`
with the return type of the workflow.

```ts
export const exampleWorkflow = workflow.define({
  args: { name: v.string() },
  handler: async (step, args): Promise<string> => {
    const queryResult = await step.runQuery(
      internal.example.exampleQuery,
      args,
    );
    const actionResult = await step.runAction(
      internal.example.exampleAction,
      { queryResult }, // pass in results from previous steps!
    );
    return actionResult;
  },
});

export const exampleQuery = internalQuery({
  args: { name: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    return `The query says... Hi ${args.name}!`;
  },
});

export const exampleAction = internalAction({
  args: { queryResult: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    return args.queryResult + " The action says... Hi back!";
  },
});
```

### Starting a workflow

Once you've defined a workflow, you can start it from a mutation or action
using `workflow.start()`.

```ts
export const kickoffWorkflow = mutation({
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const workflowId = await workflow.start(
      ctx,
      internal.example.exampleWorkflow,
      { name: "James" },
    );
  },
});
```

### Handling the workflow's result with onComplete

You can handle the workflow's result with `onComplete`. This is useful for
cleaning up any resources used by the workflow.

Note: when you return things from a workflow, you'll need to specify the return
type of your `handler` to break type cycles due to using `internal.*` functions
in the body, which then inform the type of the workflow, which is included in
the `internal.*` type.

You can also specify a `returns` validator to do runtime validation on the
return value. If it fails, your `onComplete` handler will be called with an
error instead of success. You can also do validation in the `onComplete` handler
to have more control over handling that situation.

```ts
import { vWorkflowId } from "@convex-dev/workflow";
import { vResultValidator } from "@convex-dev/workpool";

export const foo = mutation({
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const name = "James";
    const workflowId = await workflow.start(
      ctx,
      internal.example.exampleWorkflow,
      { name },
      {
        onComplete: internal.example.handleOnComplete,
        context: name, // can be anything
      },
    );
  },
});

export const handleOnComplete = mutation({
  args: {
    workflowId: vWorkflowId,
    result: vResultValidator,
    context: v.any(), // used to pass through data from the start site.
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const name = (args.context as { name: string }).name;
    if (args.result.kind === "success") {
      const text = args.result.returnValue;
      console.log(`${name} result: ${text}`);
    } else if (args.result.kind === "error") {
      console.error("Workflow failed", args.result.error);
    } else if (args.result.kind === "canceled") {
      console.log("Workflow canceled", args.context);
    }
  },
});
```

### Running steps in parallel

You can run steps in parallel by calling `step.runAction()` multiple times in
a `Promise.all()` call.

```ts
export const exampleWorkflow = workflow.define({
  args: { name: v.string() },
  handler: async (step, args): Promise<void> => {
    const [result1, result2] = await Promise.all([
      step.runAction(internal.example.myAction, args),
      step.runAction(internal.example.myAction, args),
    ]);
  },
});
```

Note: The workflow will not proceed until all steps fired off at once have completed.

### Specifying retry behavior

Sometimes actions fail due to transient errors, whether it was an unreliable
third-party API or a server restart. You can have the workflow automatically
retry actions using best practices (exponential backoff & jitter).
By default there are no retries, and the workflow will fail.

You can specify default retry behavior for all workflows on the WorkflowManager,
or override it on a per-workflow basis.

You can also specify a custom retry behavior per-step, to opt-out of retries
for actions that may want at-most-once semantics.

Workpool options:

If you specify any of these, it will override the
[`DEFAULT_RETRY_BEHAVIOR`](./src/component/pool.ts).

- `defaultRetryBehavior`: The default retry behavior for all workflows.
  - `maxAttempts`: The maximum number of attempts to retry an action.
  - `initialBackoffMs`: The initial backoff time in milliseconds.
  - `base`: The base multiplier for the backoff. Default is 2.
- `retryActionsByDefault`: Whether to retry actions, by default is false.
  - If you specify a retry behavior at the step level, it will always retry.

At the step level, you can also specify `true` or `false` to disable or use
the default policy.

```ts
const workflow = new WorkflowManager(components.workflow, {
  defaultRetryBehavior: {
    maxAttempts: 3,
    initialBackoffMs: 100,
    base: 2,
  },
  // If specified, this sets the defaults, overridden per-workflow or per-step.
  workpoolOptions: { ... }
});

export const exampleWorkflow = workflow.define({
  args: { name: v.string() },
  handler: async (step, args): Promise<void> => {
    // Uses default retry behavior & retryActionsByDefault
    await step.runAction(internal.example.myAction, args);
    // Retries will be attempted with the default behavior
    await step.runAction(internal.example.myAction, args, { retry: true });
    // No retries will be attempted
    await step.runAction(internal.example.myAction, args, { retry: false });
    // Custom retry behavior will be used
    await step.runAction(internal.example.myAction, args, {
      retry: { maxAttempts: 2, initialBackoffMs: 100, base: 2 },
    });
  },
  // If specified, this will override the workflow manager's default
  workpoolOptions: { ... },
});
```

### Specifying how many workflows can run in parallel

You can specify how many steps can run in parallel by setting the
`maxParallelism` workpool option. It has a reasonable default.
On the free tier, you should not exceed 20.
On a Pro account, you should not exceed 100 across all your workflows and workpools.
If you want to do a lot of work in parallel, you should employ batching, where
each workflow operates on a batch of work, e.g. scraping a list of links instead
of one link per workflow.

```ts
const workflow = new WorkflowManager(components.workflow, {
  workpoolOptions: {
    // You must only set this to one value per components.xyz!
    // You can set different values if you "use" multiple different components
    // in convex.config.ts.
    maxParallelism: 10,
  },
});
```

### Checking a workflow's status

The `workflow.start()` method returns a `WorkflowId`, which can then be used for querying
a workflow's status.

```ts
export const kickoffWorkflow = action({
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const workflowId = await workflow.start(
      ctx,
      internal.example.exampleWorkflow,
      { name: "James" },
    );
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

    const status = await workflow.status(ctx, workflowId);
    console.log("Workflow status after 1s", status);
  },
});
```

### Canceling a workflow

You can cancel a workflow with `workflow.cancel()`, halting the workflow's execution immmediately.
In-progress calls to `step.runAction()`, however, will finish executing.

```ts
export const kickoffWorkflow = action({
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const workflowId = await workflow.start(
      ctx,
      internal.example.exampleWorkflow,
      { name: "James" },
    );
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

    // Cancel the workflow after 1 second.
    await workflow.cancel(ctx, workflowId);
  },
});
```

### Cleaning up a workflow

After a workflow has completed, you can clean up its storage with `workflow.cleanup()`.
Completed workflows are not automatically cleaned up by the system.

```ts
export const kickoffWorkflow = action({
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const workflowId = await workflow.start(
      ctx,
      internal.example.exampleWorkflow,
      { name: "James" },
    );
    try {
      while (true) {
        const status = await workflow.status(ctx, workflowId);
        if (status.type === "inProgress") {
          await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
          continue;
        }
        console.log("Workflow completed with status:", status);
        break;
      }
    } finally {
      await workflow.cleanup(ctx, workflowId);
    }
  },
});
```

### Specifying a custom name for a step

You can specify a custom name for a step by passing a `name` option to the step.

This allows the events emitted to your logs to be more descriptive.
By default it uses the `file/folder:function` name.

```ts
export const exampleWorkflow = workflow.define({
  args: { name: v.string() },
  handler: async (step, args): Promise<void> => {
    await step.runAction(internal.example.myAction, args, { name: "FOO" });
  },
});
```

## Tips and troubleshooting

### Circular dependencies

Having the return value of workflows depend on other Convex functions can lead to circular dependencies due to the
`internal.foo.bar` way of specifying functions. The way to fix this is to explicitly type the return value of the
workflow. When in doubt, add return types to more `handler` functions, like this:

```diff
 export const supportAgentWorkflow = workflow.define({
   args: { prompt: v.string(), userId: v.string(), threadId: v.string() },
+  handler: async (step, { prompt, userId, threadId }): Promise<string> => {
     // ...
   },
 });

 // And regular functions too:
 export const myFunction = action({
   args: { prompt: v.string() },
+  handler: async (ctx, { prompt }): Promise<string> => {
     // ...
   },
 });
```

### More concise workflows

To avoid the noise of `internal.foo.*` syntax, you can use a variable.
For instance, if you define all your steps in `convex/steps.ts`, you can do this:

```diff
 const s = internal.steps;

 export const myWorkflow = workflow.define({
   args: { prompt: v.string() },
   handler: async (step, args): Promise<string> => {
+    const result = await step.runAction(s.myAction, args);
     return result;
   },
 });
```

## Limitations

Here are a few limitations to keep in mind:

- Steps can only take in and return a total of _1 MiB_ of data within a single
  workflow execution. If you run into journal size limits, you can work around
  this by storing results in the DB from your step functions and passing IDs
  around within the the workflow.
- The workflow body is internally a mutation, with each step's return value read
  from the database on each subsequent step. As a result, the limits for a
  mutation apply and limit the number and size of steps you can perform to 16MiB
  (including the workflow state overhead). See more about mutation limits here:
  https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/limits#transactions
- We currently do not collect backtraces from within function calls from workflows.
- If you need to use side effects like `fetch` or use randomness,
  you'll need to do that in a step, not in the workflow definition.
- If the implementation of the workflow meaningfully changes (steps added,
  removed, or reordered) then it will fail with a determinism violation.
  The implementation should stay stable for the lifetime of active workflows.
  See [this issue](https://github.com/get-convex/workflow/issues/35) for ideas
  on how to make this better.
